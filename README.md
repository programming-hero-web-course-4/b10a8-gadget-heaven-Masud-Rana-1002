This project is built using essential React concepts:

1. **Components**: The website is composed of reusable, functional components like `Home`, `Dashboard`, and `GetOfferNews`.
2. **Props**: Data is passed between components via props for modular and maintainable code.
3. **State Management**: Managed component states using `useState` for local states, like toggle switches and sorting.
4. **Context API**: For global state management, the Context API is used to handle the cart, wishlist, and user preferences.
5. **React Router**: Used for dynamic navigation and routing, enabling a seamless, single-page application experience.
6. **React-Helmet-Async**: For managing SEO metadata and updating the document head with titles and meta tags.
